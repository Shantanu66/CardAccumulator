# CardAccumulator 

How pleasent it would be if you could store all your necessary cards in one simple app ! Amazing right.

I propose a Fullstack android(You can  build it for IOS too) application where a person or a group of people(like families,relatives,etc) can store all their government authentication ID's(Aadhar,PAN,Driving License,etc) and their transactional banking cards(credit/debit card) all together in a common place.The Holder can save all the details of the cards and the card number is well encrypted using symmtric cyptography algorithm using the block cipher technique with an appealing UI design.
This App is built using Flutter for the client side development
For the sever side development i used NodeJs,ExpressJs and the API is built using GraphQL which results in minimized data usage due to fewer requests
For the remote database i used a nosql db-mongoDB
Also performed automation testing of the graphAPI using postman

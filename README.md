# CardAccumulator 

How pleasent it would be if you could store all your necessary cards in one simple app ! Amazing right?

I propose a Fullstack android(You can  build it for IOS too) application where a person or a group of people(like families,relatives,etc) can store all their government authentication ID's(Aadhar,PAN,Driving License,etc) and their transactional banking cards(credit/debit card) all together in a common place.
This App is built using `Flutter` for the client side development
For the sever side development i used `NodeJs`,`ExpressJs` and the API is built using `GraphQL` which results in minimized data usage due to fewer requests
For the remote database i used a nosql db-`MongoDB`
The Holder can save all the details of the cards and the card number is well encrypted using symmtric cyptography algorithm using the `block cipher technique` with an appealing UI design.
Also performed automation testing of the graphAPI using postman.Future Additions:AWS,CI/CD

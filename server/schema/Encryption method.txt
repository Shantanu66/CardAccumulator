In this method what i basically do is that i create a 128 bit key i.e a 32 character gibberish of characters and then i create an algorithm in which i first take the plaintext and count its size and then increase the size by 32 and then shift the characters by 1 place so that a space is created alternatively between them and then i traverse the key and then add each character of the key randomly at the spaces in the plaintext creating a ciphertext and i also keep track of the indexes the key characters are placed at in a booloean vector of size 32 by making the index of the key characters in the vector as True, for decryption by removing the characters which have True in index of the visited array.
